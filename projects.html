                <h4>Understanding Digital Design: Random Number Generator</h4>
                <h6>January 2022, Honors Digital Electronics</h6>
                <p>In this project, I expanded upon the previous one so that a random number was generated. To do this, I added a clock, which would stop the number generator at a random point. This project gave me more depth into how clocks work, and consequently, a better understanding of some of the mechanisms behind different integrated circuits. In this project, designing the circuit on Multisim first was especially beneficial. It allowed me to understand how the circuit should be working and, by adding many probes, I could follow the path of the current. When placing the component on the breadboard, Mutlisim showed me which pins to use and I made sure to test the circuit at intervals.</p>

                <h6>November 2021, Honors Digital Electronics</h6>
                <p>For this project, I designed a circuit which would iterate through the numbers 0-15 in binary. This project was my first time using a flip flop. This project was also my first time using an integrated circuit, so I learned a lot overall. I struggled with getting my circuit to work initially, redoing it a total of 3 times. Eventually, I figured out the breadboard wasn’t working in certain places by moving around the integrated circuit. I learned how to troubleshoot with a breadboard by creating simple circuits with LEDs as indicators to understand how current is moving within the breadboard. Before putting the pieces on the board, it was important to digitally design the circuit. I learned more features of Multisim, the circuit design software I used.</p>

                <h4>Swift Spritz</h4>
                <h6>May 2021, AP Computer Science Applications</h6>
                <p>Annually, the Engineering Academy holds an Entrepreneurship Competition. Students will come up with a product to solve a problem, and they must prove to their peers and industry judges that their product is unique, marketable, and profitable. This year, my team designed a machine that automates the cleaning, disinfecting, sterilization, and pouching process for medical tools after we noticed the problem of high infection rates related to improper cleaning. The whole team worked heavily on design. We struggled on creating a compact and simple design that would also be better than the current solutions. I learned a lot about the process of brainstorming and designing, as we spent 9 out of the 16 days just sketching and went through 3 major iterations. Because I spent so much time getting to know the current systems and the needs of medical practices by talking to medical professionals, I guided the sketching process by suggesting features and we would work together to figure out how to implement them. We had started off with a 5-layer system, and then gradually brought it down to 1 layer with a pouching being opened at the bottom for the tools to fall into.

                <h6>October 2020 - November 2020, AP Computer Science Applications</h6>
                <p>For this project, we were tasked to create an educational game. The purpose of our game is to teach ionization trends. The player shoots photons from a cannon to remove electrons from the atom. My main role in this project was to manage our Git repository. I also coded the ionization part of our game, which includes the energy arrow and bar and ensuring that the proper amount of energy is reached before the user can remove an electron. Although this project was my first time working with git branches, I picked the concept up quickly. I helped my other group members push their code, pull updated files, and I merged the branches. When merging my group member’s code, there would occasionally be conflicts. When this occurred, I merged the master branch to the current branch locally. Then, I would manually make edits to ensure the code works as intended.

                <p>In this project, we wanted to create a fun game in Greenfoot that would highlight our skills in java. The project was supplemented with a screencast explaining object-oriented concepts. We split up the work evenly and I, worked with my partner, to code the project and create the screencast. Our game is a driving game in which the user controls a car to pick up coins and dodge cones. One challenge I faced was randomly choosing a lane to place the cone or coin. I chose to create a method that would return the x-coordinate of a random lane by picking a random number between 1 and 4, exclusive of 4. This method could then be called when adding the object to the world. My partner and I maintained constant communication, sending the code back and forth almost every day. This created a collaborative environment and we helped each other work through and challenges.</p>

                <h4>Aerodynamic Design</h4>
                <h6>January 2020, Honors Principles Of Engineering</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to recommend a projectile design. Our client, Nitro Planes, was looking to produce toy projectiles and wanted far-flying design recommendations. Each person in my team made two designs, and we would choose one design for our whole team to recommend. My main role in this project was to create my two paper rockets and write a design evaluation for each. I also delegated tasks and ensured the whole team stayed on task. I named my first design Jimmy Turner. In 8th-grade history class, we had learned that groves that went around the inside of the barrel of a gun, like a candy cane, helped bullets fly straighter and farther. I used this knowledge when designing Jimmy Turner; Jimmy Turner’s fins were slanted slightly to ensure it spun in the air, like a bullet. I learned from this experience and from seeing other people’s designs. For my second projectile, which I named Bar Code, I used duct tape on the outside of the rocket to secure the cone and I swept the wings back. In this project, I went through the design process and I improved my documentation skills.</p>

                <h6>October 2019, Honors Principles Of Engineering</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to work in a team to create a mechanical winch that could lift a 100-gram object up 30 cm. We also were required to present a simulation of our mechanical winch using NetLogo. My main role in this project was programming the NetLogo simulation, along with aiding my team in building the electrical and mechanical components. A challenge I faced in creating the NetLogo Simulation was to come up with a mathematical equation to adjust the placement of the gears and axles depending on the agents surrounding it. Through this project, I gained more experience with programming simulations and how to problem-solve.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a software in which a client would be able to manipulate images using a series of effects whose values could be changed. My partner and I chose our client to be a Phone Case Store that wanted a recognizable manipulation that could be applied to all their images. The client would add images to a folder, change the parameters to suit their likings, and run our code which asked them what manipulations they wanted to be applied on their images. The program would then save the manipulated images to a new folder. My partner and I evenly split the programming and documentation. We worked together closely and helped each other through bugs. My efforts were mainly focused on programming. I programmed the “triangle side”, “horizontal line”, and “drop shadow” effects, and I helped my partner with the “logo” and “Triangles & Rectangles” effects. I also worked on a feature that would allow multiple manipulations to be made to a singular image. This feature was harder to program. I tried many different approaches before I was finally able to find one that works. This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and documentation skills.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to create an app. My partner and I decided to make a game. In our game, a user controls the vertical movement of a bird which consistently moves along the x-axis of the screen. The goal is to reach the edge of a screen without crashing into spikes. We split up how much and what parts we would program. It was my role to organize the documentation. I helped make the spikes move and set new y-positions for the spikes. My partner and I were having trouble making our spikes move. We both proposed many different ways of solving the problem and tested many variations of code. We finally found a way in which to make the spike "head" in a certain direction and add spikes to all sides of the block. This project helped me learn the importance of organization in code and ways to read and understand code.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a game or storyline with a great amount of user interaction. My partner and I decided to make a storyline in which the user must try to survive in a forest. The user is faced with different scenarios and they are given choices to make. We worked side by side and discussed every part to make sure it included both of our ideas. In this project, I cleaned up animations and programmed new scenes. My partner and I did encounter some challenges with the animations messing up. We were able to pinpoint the problem and find solutions. There was an instance where we wanted a "sparks flying" effect, but it would die out after a mere couple of seconds. I was able to figure out that there was a limit to the number of clones you could have, so I would kill a clone after its job was done. This project helped me learn to think critically and problem solve.</p>
