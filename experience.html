        <p>As part of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have been introduced to careers and workplaces in the engineering field. I have learned a lot through field trips and numerous guest speakers. These experiences have helped me gain more insight into topics that I am already interested in or I want to explore more in the future. <br> </p>

        <p><br>I visited the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory twice; the first time I went to the National Ignition Facility and the second time was a virtual job shadow. The National Ignition Facility is a large laser facility that was built to research fusion. Our tour guide was a computer scientist who provided us with more knowledge of how the facility utilizes computer science and computer scientists, which is the field that I am most interested in. This tour was also very engaging because it related to my interests in the future of energy and alternative energy. <br></p>

        </figure>

        <p><br>The second trip was particularly influential because I was able to look into specific jobs I could pursue and how they fit into LLNL’s overall purpose of research and helping the people. At this job shadow, I heard from a web developer and a data scientist. This field trip gave me more insight into the daily lives of these two careers. <br></p>
        
        <p><br>Another field trip I took was to Workday, a human resources company. They presented to us their student information system software for college students. At one point in the presentation, they couldn’t get their project to work, so they showed us images and described what it was supposed to do. The experience was memorable because I learned how you could handle a situation when your prototype breaks.<br></p>

        <p><br>The most recent field trip I took was to Ardenwood, a historic farm. The volunteers there showed us the whole process, from creating compost to selling the foods. This farm placed an emphasis on sustainability, so they showed us how they were deterring pests, growing food year-round, and enriching the soil. The field trip was memorable because I learned about how we can esure farming isn’t hurting the planet and our communities. <br></p>

        <p><br>One of the most influential guest speakers to me was Ms. Grace Ermi. She uses machine learing to aid environmental scientists in the field do their research, like creating a program to identify killer whales. It was so influential to me because, with my passion for both environmental science and computer science, it exposed me to a path I could take to help the planet through code. <br></p>

        <p><br>Dr. Jason Yosinski, a machine learning scientist, was another influential guest speaker. He talked to our class about machine learning and he demonstrated a couple of his projects, such as a deep visualization toolbox and a quadruped robot that learned to move. I really enjoyed learning about his projects and it inspired me to learn dive deeper into machine learning.<br></p>

        <p><br>Mr. Maynard Holiday presented to us about how he and his team dealt with radiation in Chernobyl. I was amazed by how they thought creatively and further advanced the field of robotics to find solutions. This was a problem no one had ever faced before. His talk showed me how you should always persevere and learn from your mistakes, especially as it relates to the engineering design process.<br></p>

        <p><br>Mr. Joe Vierra presented to us about his software startups. It was interesting to learn how he persevered and things he learned about starting from scratch along the way. He emphasized that for any project, the agile method was the best as it kept the momentum as it didn’t let mistakes get too big.<br></p>

        <p><br>Through the Engineering Academy, I connected with my mentor, Rajani Bansal. She is an environmental engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Her guidance has helped me learn how to present myself professionally. The Mentorship Program also gave me the opportunity to learn more about other careers, such as software engineering and mobile app development. </p>
