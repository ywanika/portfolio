        <p>As part of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have been introduced to careers and workplaces in the engineering field. I have learned a lot through the field trips and numerous guest speakers. These experiences have helped me gain more insight into topics that I am already interested in or I want to explore more in the future. <br> </p>

        <p><br>I was able to visit Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility. The National Ignition Facility is a large laser facility built to research fusion. Our tour guide was a computer scientist who worked at the facility. She provided us with more knowledge of how the facility utilizes computer science and computer scientists, which is the field that I am most interested in. This tour was also very engaging because it related to my interests in the future of energy and alternative energy. <br></p>
        
        <p><br>Another field trip I took was to Workday, an HR company. They presented a college management system made for students. At one point, they couldn’t get their project to work, so they showed us images and described what it was supposed to do. The experience was memorable because I learned how you could handle a situation when your prototype breaks.<br></p>

        </figure>

        <p><br>I visited LLNL again, this time for a virtual job shadow. This trip was particularly influential because I was able to look into specific jobs I could pursue and how they fit into LLNL’s overall purpose of research and helping the people. At this job shadow, I was compelled to web development and data analysis. The field trip allowed me to learn more about these two paths.<br></p>
        
        <p><br>The most recent field trip I took was to an urban farm. I had the opportunity to learn more about the systems that are allowing modern farms in small spaces to be sustainable and contribute to their community. <br></p>

        <p><br>Dr. Jason Yosinski was an influential guest speaker. He is a machine learning scientist and a founding member of Uber AI Labs. Dr. Yosinski talked to our class about machine learning and he demonstrated a couple of his projects, such as a deep visualization toolbox. I am very interested in machine learning and I had just started learning machine learning outside of class when Dr. Yosinski spoke in our class. Dr. Yosinski provided me with a deeper explanation of what neural networks are and how they work. While he was completing his Ph.D. at Cornell, Dr. Yosinski worked on a quadruped robot that learned to move. I really enjoyed learning about this project and this inspired me to want to learn more about artificial intelligence. <br></p>

        <p><br>Ms. Grace Ermi was another influential speaker for me. She uses AI and ML to aid environmental scientists in the field do their research. It was influential to me because, with my passion for both environmental science and computer science, it exposed me to another path I could take to help the planet through code.<br></p>

        <p><br>Mr. Maynard Holiday presented to us about how he and his team dealt with radiation in Chernobyl. I was amazed by how they thought creatively and further advanced the field of robotics to find solutions. This was a problem no one had ever faced before. His talk showed me how you should always persevere and learn from your mistakes, especially as it relates to the engineering design process.<br></p>

        <p><br>Mr. Joe Vierra presented to us about his software startups. It was interesting to learn how he persevered and things he learned about starting from scratch along the way. He emphasized, that for any project, the agile method was the best as it kept the momentum and didn’t let mistakes get too big.<br></p>

        <p><br>Through the Engineering Academy, I connected with my mentor, Rajani Bansal. She is an environmental engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Her guidance has helped me learn how to present myself professionally. The Mentorship Program also gave me the opportunity to learn more about other careers, such as software engineering and mobile app development. </p>
